    "The process of designing a good database system is very complicated and many aspects have to be considered. Before this module, I knew next to nothing about databases or SQL. My initial impression of database systems was that they were simple file-io operations and the programmers have to manage the files manually, or with a very thin layer of abstraction. However, SQL really surprised me with how much it abstracts away the underlying operations of reading and writing to the file system. It could also perform many advanced queries, which I assumed were always done in application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, the database design process was quite painful. When designing ER diagrams and relational models, it is very easy to make mistakes, which became quite confusing down the line when I started to implement the actual database. Another issue was when I first started the project, I did not have a very clear idea of what I wanted to do. This meant that a lot of the entities and relationships in the ER were missing attributes that I needed/has too many extra attributes, so I had to keep changing the database schema. I had also severely underestimated how long the design process took. Even though the SQL scripts for the database was only at most a few hundred lines of code, it took a lot longer to write because of my unfamiliarity with SQL and databases in general (each SQL statement also seems to be worth multiple statements in other languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my major takeaways from this project is to always have a rough plan first before trying to do anything. For almost all of my projects, I never really had any plan before starting on the project. Rather, I would start with the implementation first and the plan would form as I go, so I can adjust the plan depending on how easy various parts are to implement. However, for this project, it was much more important to have a clear plan beforehand was much more important and even though the implementation was relatively easy, it was much more difficult because I had to keep going back and forth between the design and UI parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UI part of the project was the most amount of code I wrote in a short amount of time. Web design is also quite new to me, so having to write a function website that looked good in less than a month was quite challenging. Because I didn't have a very clear understanding of how Bootstrap/Flask worked, I had to experiment a lot with the various UI components and that wasted a lot of time."
